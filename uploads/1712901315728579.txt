sets needed; Matrices – Matrices to represent relations between data, and necessary linear algebraic operations on matrices
-Approximately representing matrices by decompositions (SVD and PCA); Statistics: Descriptive Statistics: distributions
and probability – Statistical Inference: Populations and samples – Statistical modeling – probability distributions – fitting
a model – Hypothesis Testing
